A: Yes. Affiliates can operate under a registered business name, provided invoices and documents clearly mention legal details such as PAN, GST, and banking information to ensure compliance.

A: Yes, but changes must be communicated to managers in advance and may only take effect from the next cycle to avoid disruptions.

A: Affiliates’ payments may also be impacted if advertisers delay confirmations. However, vCommission maintains transparency and ensures affiliates are paid as soon as advertiser billing is settled.

Q175. Do advertisers have control over targeting restrictions?
A: Yes. Advertisers can specify geo, device, demographic, and traffic restrictions, which affiliates must comply with strictly.

A: Advertisers can raise disputes with their account managers, supported by data and logs. Resolutions are handled by vCommission in collaboration with affiliates.

A: Affiliates bear international bank charges, capped at USD 50 per transfer. Any excess cost is absorbed by the affiliate’s bank.

A: Cryptocurrency payouts are not supported in the current policy. Payments are processed only through official banking and Tipalti systems.

A: Tax details must be accurate at the time of invoicing. Post-submission changes may require corrected invoices.

Q190. What happens if affiliates operate without GST registration?

Q191. Can affiliates appeal advertiser rejections?
A: Yes. Affiliates may appeal rejected conversions by providing proof such as logs or campaign data. Final decisions depend on advertiser confirmation.

Q192. How are incomplete or duplicate leads treated?

A: Yes. Affiliates may run small-scale tests to evaluate campaign performance before scaling. Tests must still comply with restrictions.

Q204. Can affiliates integrate third-party tracking tools?
